# ðŸŒ± Trashify ðŸŒ±

## Description

Trashify is an application that allows users to create and locate trash bins near them. It provides an easy-to-use interface for managing trash bin locations and finding the nearest ones.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend & Backend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **ORM**: [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- **Database**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- **Caching**: [Memcached](https://memcached.org/) (run on Docker)
- **Google APIs**: Utilized for location services
- **RPC Framework**: [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) Utilized for server to server communication as there is an AI mircoservice used by this app. This AI mircoservice was used to find the nearest coordinates in a list based on current coordinates within the Ball Tree algorithm.

## Features

- **Create Trash Bins**: Users can add new trash bin locations.
- **Find Nearby Trash Bins**: Users can search for trash bins near their current location.
- **Optimized Performance**: Includes database indexing and caching to improve response times and reduce latency.
- **AI Integration**: Using Sci-Kit learn lib, I implemented a Ball Tree algorithm using AI models that were trained!

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- Docker (for Memcached)
- PostgreSQL (can use docker too if you wish)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trashify.git
   cd trashify
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```plaintext
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/yourdatabase
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   MEMCACHED_URL=localhost:11211
   ```

4. **Run Memcached in Docker:**

   ```bash
   docker run --name memcached -d memcached
   ```

5. **Run database migrations:**

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

6. **Start the application:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Database Optimization

To enhance performance, the database has been optimized with indexing. These indexes are declared in the Prisma schema and have been migrated to the SQL database.

## Caching

To reduce latency from Google API calls, Memcached is used to cache frequently accessed data. This setup is managed through Docker for simplicity and scalability.

## API Documentation
